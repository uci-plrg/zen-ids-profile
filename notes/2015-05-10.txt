Raw Data

1. ML loads routine edges from merged routine-edge.run
2. FeatureService loads training edge set from file (?)

Request Opcodes

0. feature data for an edge (training set)
1. edge label (total: <role-counts>)
2. graph properties (e.g., total routine <role-counts>)


Request Format

12 bytes: { <opcode> (1) | <from-hash> (4) | <from-opcode> (2) | <to-hash> (4) | <empty> (1) }


Response Format

8 byte <role-counts>: { # admin (4) | # anon (4) }

0. feature data: { caller <role-counts>, calling sites <role-counts>, target <role-counts>,
                   target file <role-counts>, target directory <role-counts>,
                   word <role-counts>* }
1. edge <role-counts>
2. routine <role-counts>

#: number of runs having this role as the lowest observed


Dictionary: each word with high skew: { word, <role-counts> }
Call Site: role (so far)? { <role-counts> }
Call Sites of All Callers: exclusive role? { <role-counts> }
Call Target:
  routine role? { <role-counts> }
  file role? { <role-counts> }
  directory role? { <role-counts> }



Configuration
  min skew
  min word instances



-----------------

ML already has all the labels for all the edges in the dataset. It needs to know
the features for each edge.
